Student Depression Analysis and Prediction

This is a data-driven project analyzing depression in students using machine learning models to predict mental health conditions based on survey data. The project involves comprehensive data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation to achieve high predictive accuracy.
The project focuses on analyzing depression in students to understand its prevalence, contributing factors, and potential predictive indicators using data analysis and machine learning techniques. 

The goal is to:
Analyze Patterns: Explore how various factors (e.g., academic pressure, social environment, personal circumstances) correlate with depression in students.
Predict Depression: Develop machine learning models to predict the likelihood of students experiencing depression based on survey or behavioral data.
Provide Insights: Highlight actionable insights for mental health interventions and policy recommendations tailored for students. It aims to provide insights into factors influencing student mental health and offer a foundation for proactive interventions.

Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and imbalanced datasets.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Uncovered patterns and trends in mental health and demographic data.
Machine Learning Models: Built and evaluated models to predict depression risk with high accuracy.
Tools and Libraries: Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.

Highlights

Achieved high accuracy and robust performance metrics using well-tuned machine learning algorithms.
Visualized key relationships between demographic factors and mental health outcomes
